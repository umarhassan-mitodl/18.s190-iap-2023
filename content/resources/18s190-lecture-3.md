  youtube_description: "MIT 18.S190 Introduction To Metric Spaces, IAP 2023\nInstructor:\
    \ Paige Bright\n\nView the complete course: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s190-introduction-to-metric-spaces-january-iap-2023/\n\
    YouTube Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP613ULTyHAqz04niYf722x7S\n\
    \nWe motivate the concept of compact sets on Euclidean space with norms, support\
    \ of functions, and finite sets. We also prove the Heine-Borel theorem and introduce\
    \ the notions of topological and sequential compactness.\n\nThis video has been\
    \ dubbed using an artificial voice via https://aloud.area120.google.com to increase\
