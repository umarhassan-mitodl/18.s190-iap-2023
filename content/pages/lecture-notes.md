### Lecture 1: Motivation, Intuition, and Examples

Outline: Motivation, definition, and intuition behind metric spaces. Redefining *18.100A Real Analysis* and *18.100P Real Analysis* in terms of metrics: open/closed sets, convergence, Cauchy sequences, and continuity.

### Lecture 2: General Theory

Outline: Some general theory of metric spaces regarding convergence, open and closed sets, continuity, and their relationship to one another.

### Lecture 3: Compact Sets in Rⁿ

Outline: Norms and analysis on finite sets (as motivation for compact sets). Topological compactness and sequential compactness. Today will focus purely on theorems regarding compact subsets of Rⁿ. The Heine-Borel theorem and the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.

### Lecture 4: Compact Metric Spaces

Outline: Compact sets on general metric spaces. Showing sequential compactness is equivalent to topological compactness, which is equivalent to being totally bounded and complete (on metric spaces).
